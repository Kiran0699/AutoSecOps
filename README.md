#  🔐 AutoSecOps: AI-Driven Cybersecurity Response Pipeline

AutoSecOps is a fully autonomous AI-powered pipeline for real-time threat detection, classification, and response using streaming data, LLM-based analysis, and reinforcement learning-based agents.

## 🌐 Features
- Real-time ingestion of security logs with Kafka
- Spark streaming pipeline for processing
- LLM-based log classification using transformers
- RL-based agent for autonomous threat response
- Airflow DAG for periodic model retraining
- Containerized with Docker + Kafka setup

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Start Kafka
$ docker-compose up -d

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start streaming
$ python src/ingestion/kafka_producer.py
$ spark-submit src/processing/spark_streaming_job.py
```

## 🧰 AI Agents
- **Log Analyzer** (LLM-based)
- **Threat Classifier** (BART zero-shot)
- **Response Planner** (RL agent using PPO)

## 📊 Dashboards
Real-time logs can be integrated into Grafana or viewed via Spark console.
